# DOM

A DOM has tree-like structure and it is a representation of the HTML document in the form of objects. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the DOM tree. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other nodes.

The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
