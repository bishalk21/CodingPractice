# CSS Position

- **Objective:** The position property defines how an element will be positioned on a page.

### CSS Positioning Methods

Positioning elements appropriately on the web pages is a necessity for a good layout design. There are several methods in CSS that you can use for positioning elements.

### Static Positioning

A static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `z-index` properties.

`Example`

```css
.box {
  padding: 20px;
  background: #7dc765;
}
```

---

### Relative Positioning

A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.

In the relative positioning scheme the element's box position is calculated according to the normal flow. Then the box is shifted from this normal position according to the properties â€” `top or bottom` and/or `left` or `right`.

`Example`

```css
.box {
  position: relative;
  left: 100px;
}
```

> **Note:** A relatively positioned element can be moved and overlap other elements, but it keeps the space originally reserved for it in the normal flow.

---

### Absolute Positioning

An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, it will be positioned on a page relative to the 'top-left' corner of the browser window. The box's offsets further can be specified using one or more of the properties `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

Absolutely positioned elements are taken out of the normal flow entirely and thus take up no space when placing sibling elements. However, it can overlap other elements depending on the z-index property value. Also, an absolutely positioned element can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins.

`Example`

```css
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 200px;
  left: 100px;
}
```

---

### Fixed Position

Fixed positioning is a subcategory of absolute positioning.

The only difference is, a fixed positioned element is fixed with respect to the browser's viewport and does not move when scrolled.

`Example`

```css
.box {
  position: fixed;
  top: 200px;
  left: 100px;
}
```

> **Note:** In case of the print media type, the fixed positioned element is rendered on every page, and is fixed with respect to the page box (even in print-preview). IE7 and IE8 support the fixed value only if a `<!DOCTYPE>` is specified.

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `static`   | Default value. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `relative` | The element is positioned relative to its normal position. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify the offset from the element's normal position.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `absolute` | The element is positioned absolutely relative to its first positioned ancestor element. If no positioned ancestor is found, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify the offset from the element's position in the normal flow.                         |
| `fixed`    | The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify the offset from the element's position in the normal flow.                                                                                         |
| `sticky`   | The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. The element is positioned relative to its normal flow until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is fixed in place (like position:fixed). The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify the offset from the element's position in the normal flow. |

- first positioned ancestor element: The first ancestor element that has a position other than static. e.g. `position: relative;` or `position: absolute;`
