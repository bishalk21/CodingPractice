## Web Workers

- used in web content to run scripts in background threads.
- can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.
- can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest or fetch.
- Modern JS offers additional threads by using web workers which is used to spin off a sub-program which runs concurrently with the main thread in a thread of its own.
