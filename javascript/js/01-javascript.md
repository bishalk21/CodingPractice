# Programming Languages

- programming languages are a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task
- programming languages are used to create web pages, mobile apps, games, and more

## High Level vs Low Level

| High Level                                       | Low Level                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| easy to read and write                           | difficult to read and write                   |
| abstracted                                       | concrete                                      |

# Javascript

## What is javascript?

- high level: no need worry about computer memory, registers, etc.
- synchronous: one command at a time
- interpreted programming language: no need to compile code before running it
- object-oriented: based on objects, stores data in properties, and methods that perform actions on the data
- multi-paradigm: can use different programming styles like functional, procedural, and object-oriented
- lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

## History of JavaScript

- LiveScript -> JavaScript
- [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (ES5, ES6)
  - ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International.
  - It was created to standardize JavaScript.
  - JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript.
- ECMAScript (ES2016, ES2017)
- ES5 -> ES6 -> ES2016 -> ES2017 -> ES2018 -> ES2019 -> ES2020

## HTML, CSS vs JavaScript

- HTML: content, nouns
- CSS: style, adjectives
- JavaScript: behavior, verbs

- HTML and CSS
  - Markup language used to describe and define elements within a document.
- JavaScript
  - Programming language used to communicate instructions to a machine.
