# Handling ESC keypress event

Keyboards events are very useful for handling user input. In this lesson, we will learn how to handle the ESC keypress event.

These events are fired when a user presses a key on the keyboard. The event object contains information about the key that was pressed.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  if (event.keyCode === 27) {
    console.log("Escape key pressed");
  }
});
```
