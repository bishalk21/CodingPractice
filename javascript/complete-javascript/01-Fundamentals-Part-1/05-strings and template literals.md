# Strings

- Strings are a primitive data type in JavaScript
- Strings are used to represent text
- Strings are immutable
- Strings are surrounded by double or single quotes
- Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator

## String Length

- The `length` property returns the length of a string
- The `length` property does not count whitespace as a character

## Accessing String Characters

- Strings are zero-indexed
- The first character is in position `0`
- The last character is in position `length - 1`

## String Methods

- Methods are actions that can be performed on objects
- Methods are called by appending the object or variable name with a period, the method name, and parentheses
- Methods often take arguments (in the parentheses) to specify how to perform the action
- Methods can return a value

## String Methods - `toUpperCase()`

# Template Literals

- Template literals can contain
  - placeholders
  - multi-line strings
  - expressions

## Template Literals - Placeholders

- Placeholders are enclosed by `${ }`
- Placeholders can contain
  - variables
  - expressions

```javascript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;
const job = "Web Developer";

console.log(bisha);
```

## Template Literals - Multi-line Strings

- Multi-line strings are enclosed by backticks (\` \`)

```javascript
const bisha = `I'm ${name} and \n\
 I'm ${age} years old. \n\
 I am a ${job}.`;
console.log(bisha);
```
