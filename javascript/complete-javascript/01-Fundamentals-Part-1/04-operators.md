An operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).

JavaScript has the following types of operators:\

# Arithmetic operators

- Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| \*       | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulus        |
| ++       | Increment      |
| --       | Decrement      |
| \*\*     | Exponentiation |
| (...)    | Grouping       |

# Assignment operators

- Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| =        | x = y   | x = y      |
| +=       | x += y  | x = x + y  |
| -=       | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
| \*=      | x \*= y | x = x \* y |
| /=       | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
| %=       | x %= y  | x = x % y  |

# Comparison operators

- Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

| Operator | Description                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| ==       | equal to                          |
| ===      | equal value and equal type        |
| !=       | not equal                         |
| !==      | not equal value or not equal type |
| >        | greater than                      |
| <        | less than                         |
| >=       | greater than or equal to          |
| <=       | less than or equal to             |

# Logical operators

- Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

| Operator | Description | Example            |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| &&       | and         | x < 10 && x > 5    |
| \|\|     | or          | x < 10 \|\| x > 5  |
| !        | not         | !(x < 10 && x > 5) |

# String operators

- String operators are used to concatenate two strings.

| Operator | Description              | Example             |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| +        | concatenates two strings | "Hello " + "World!" |

# Type operators

- Type operators are used to determine the type of a variable or a value.

| Operator | Description                               | Example       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| typeof   | returns the type of a variable or a value | typeof "John" |

# Bitwise operators

- Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-by-bit operations on variables or values.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| &        | and         | 5 & 1   |
| \|       | or          | 5 \| 1  |
| ^        | xor         | 5 ^ 1   |
| ~        | not         | ~ 5     |
| <<       | zero fill   | 5 << 1  |
| >>       | sign fill   | 5 >> 1  |

# Conditional (ternary) operator

- The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.

| Operator | Description | Example              |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| ?        | ternary     | 5 > 1 ? "yes" : "no" |

# Comma operator

- The comma operator is used to evaluate multiple expressions, where the result of each expression is returned.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| ,        | comma       | 5 , 1   |

# Unary operators

- Unary operators are operators with only one operand.

| Operator | Description | Example  |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| delete   | delete      | delete x |
| typeof   | typeof      | typeof x |
| void     | void        | void x   |
| +        | unary plus  | +x       |
| -        | unary neg   | -x       |
| !        | logical not | !x       |
| ~        | bitwise not | ~x       |
| ++       | increment   | ++x      |
| --       | decrement   | --x      |

# Relational operators

- Relational operators are used to test the relationships between variables or values.

| Operator   | Description | Example        |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| in         | in          | x in y         |
| instanceof | instanceof  | x instanceof y |

# Equality operators

- Equality operators are used to compare the equality (or inequality) of two variables or values.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| ==       | equal       | x == y  |
| !=       | not equal   | x != y  |
| ===      | equal       | x === y |
| !==      | not equal   | x !== y |
