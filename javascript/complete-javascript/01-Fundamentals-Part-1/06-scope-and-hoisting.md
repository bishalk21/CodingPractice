Scope is bucketing values together. You can go from the most enclosed â†’ outwards. You cant go from out to in.

### lexical scoping

Lexical is related to 'author' time

`this` gives us that dynamic 'run-time' scope

Anti-pattern :)

From James Churchill to Everyone: (03:14 PM)(^ referring to defining all of your variables globally)

### block scoping

### hoisting

var only respects the function context

### var, let, and const

let doesn't create properties onto the window object

let respects block scope

const follows same rules as let

const only makes top level variable immutable - if you make an array or object the insides can be changed

Temporal dead zone

you can't use that variable in that scope until its defined later on in the page

# Hoisting in JavaScript

`Hoisting` simple gives higher specificity to javascript declarations. Thus, it makes the computer read and process declarations first before analyzing other code in program.

`Note:` Hosting does not mean JavaScript rearranges or move code above one anothers. <br>

E.g.

```JavaScript
console.log(name); // Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined
let name = 'Deepa';
```

> variables declared with let and const are hoisted but not initialized with a default value.

> Accessing let or const before it's declared will give: Uncaught ReferenceError: can't access before initialization <br>

> Remember the error message tells variable is initialized somewhere.

## Variable hoisting with var

When interpreter hoists a variable declared with var, it initialized its value to undefined, unlike let or const. <br>
E.g.

```JavaScript
console.log(name); // undefined
var name = 'deepa';
console.log(name); // deepa
```

Now let's analyze this behaviour:

```JavaScript
var name;
console.log(name); // undefined
name = 'partha';
console.log(name); // partha
```

> Remember, the first **console.log(name)** outputs **undefined** because name is **hoisted**, and given a default value (not because variable is never declared). <br>

> Using **undefined** variable will throw **ReferenceError**

```JavaScript
console.log(name); // Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined
```

Now let's see if we don't declare var what happens.

```JavaScript
console.log(name); // partha
name = 'partha';
```

**name** = assigning a variable that's not declared is valid. <br>

> JavaScript let us access variable before they're declared. This behaviour is an unusual part of javascript and can lead to errors. <br>

> Using variable before it's declaration is not desirable.

## The temporal Dead Zone

The reason why we get reference error when we try to access let or const before its declaration is `Temperal Dead Zome` <br>

- The **TDZ** starts at beginning of the variables enclosing scope and ends when it is declared. <br>
- Accessing variable in **TDZ** gives ReferenceError <br>

E.g.

```JavaScript
{
    // start of foo's TDZ
    let bar = 'bar';
    console.log(bar); // bar
    console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: // Because we're in TDZ
    let foo = 'foo';
    // end of foo's TDZ
}
```

- type of **TDZ** for let or const: `ReferenceError`
- type of **TDZ** for var: `undefined`

## Functional Hoisting

Function declarations are hoisted too. Function hoisting allows us to call function before it is declared or defined.

```JavaScript
foo();
function foo() {
    console.log('foo'); // foo
}
```

`Note:` only function declaration are hoisted not function expressions. <br>
E.g.

```JavaScript
foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
var foo = function() {

}

bar(); // Uncaught ReferenceError
let bar = function() {

}
```

**Uncaught ReferenceError:** can't access 'bar' before initialization similarly for `const`.

## For function that is never declared:

```JavaScript
foo(); // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
```
