# Functions calling other functions

- Functions can call other functions.
- Functions can call themselves.
- Functions can call themselves recursively.

```js
function cutFruitPieces(fruit) {
  return fruit * 4;
}

function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  const applePieces = cutFruitPieces(apples);
  const orangePieces = cutFruitPieces(oranges);

  const juice = `Juice with ${applePieces} pieces of apple and ${orangePieces} pieces of orange.`;
  return juice;
}

console.log(fruitProcessor(2, 3));
```

# Reviewing functions

- Functions are a way to group code together.
