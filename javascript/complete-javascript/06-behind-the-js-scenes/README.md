### Scope and Scope Chain

- Scoping asks the question, where can we access a variable? or where can we access a function? or where can we access a block of code?
- There are three types of scopes in JavaScript: the global scope, the function scope, and the block scope.
- Only let and const are block scoped. var is function scoped.
- In JavaScript, we have lexical scoping (static scoping), so the rules of where we can access a variable are set in stone by the time that we write our code, and they are based on where functions are declared.
- Every scope has access to the variables of the scope that is outside of it. This is called scope chain.
- When a variable is not found in the current scope, the engine looks for it in the outer scope, and if it is not found there, it looks in the next outer scope, and so on, until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope. If the variable is not found in the global scope, then the engine throws a ReferenceError or null.
- The scope chain is a one way street. It goes from the inner scope to the outer scope, but not the other way around.
- The scope chain in a certain scope is equal to adding together all the variable environments of the all parent scopes.
