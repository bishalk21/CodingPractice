# Day 01 - JavaScript Basics

1. Comment Your JavaScript Code

- Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
- Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

```JavaScript
// This is an in-line comment.
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

2. Declare JavaScript Variables

- In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.

## Data Types

- Data Types in JavaScript:

```JavaScript
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Undefined
  - Null
  - Symbol
  - Object
  - BigInt
  - Array
```

## Variables

- Variables are named containers for storing data values.
- allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
- Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to.

* To create a variable in JavaScript, we use keywords: - var - let - const

```JavaScript
var myName = "Bishal";
let ourName = "TeamBishal";
const pi = 3.14;
```

3. Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

- In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
- If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

```JavaScript
var a;
var b = 2;
a = 7;
b = a;
```

4. Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

- It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

```JavaScript
var a = 9;
```

5. Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

- If you have already declared a variable, you can assign it to another variable using the assignment operator.

```JavaScript
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a;
```

6. Declare String Variables

- String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote.

```JavaScript
var myFirstName = "Bishal";
var myLastName = "Karki";
```

## String Literals

- String in JavaScript are used for storing and manipulating text, wrapped in single or double quotes.
- String literals are string values that are written directly in your code.
- A string literal is a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

```JavaScript
var myFirstName = "Bishal";
var myLastName = "Karki";
```

7. Understanding Uninitialized Variables

- When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
- If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number".
- If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

```JavaScript
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```

# DSA - Problem Solving

### Running Sum of 1d Array

Q. Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]). Return the running sum of nums.

```JavaScript

const runningSum = function(nums){
    let sum = 0;
        let result = [];
    for (let i=0, i< nums.length, i++){
    sum = sum + nums[i];
    result.push(sum);
    }
    return result;
}

```

# Interview Questions

### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?

- Object constructor:

  ```JavaScript
  var obj = new Object();
  ```

- Object literal -

  ```JavaScript
      var obj = {};
  ```

- Object.create(): The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

  ```JavaScript
   var obj = Object.create(null);
  ```

- ES6 class:

  ```JavaScript
   class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        }
    }

    var obj = new Person('Bishal');
  ```

- Function constructor: Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

  ```JavaScript
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  var obj = new Person('Bishal');
  ```

- Function constructor with prototype: This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

  ```JavaScript
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }
    Person.prototype.getName = function() {
        return this.name;
    }

    var obj = new Person('Bishal');
  ```

- Singleton pattern: A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.
  ```JavaScript
  var object = new (function () {
  this.name = "Bishal";
  })();
  ```
