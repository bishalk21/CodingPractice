# Javascript Notes

## Description ##

This repository contains part of the materials created for the different javascript trainings i've been doing since 2010

This part includes:

- Javascript Basics as a programming language (variables, operators, conditionals, loops, data types, ...)
- Important concepts associated to the language and how to manage them (JSON, AJAX, Events, DOM, BOM, ...)
- Some other concepts that are a bit more advanced but also fundamentals to understand the "power" of the language (closures, regular expressions, objects, inheritance)
